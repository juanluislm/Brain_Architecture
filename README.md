From Computer Architecture to Brain Architecture

We know from Amdahl's Law that scalability has its limits. Therefore, instead of putting more cores in a processor,
we should arrange them differently. I, along with an entire community, believe that this new arrangement should follow 
the brain structure.

This paper was written by me, Juan Lopez Marcano. It presents my ideas and uses the literature to back them up. The 
objective of this paper was to fulfill the requisites of ECE 5504 Computer Architecture, taught by Dr. JoAnn Paul in 
Fall 2015 at Virginia Tech. However, I may take additional steps to empirically demonstrate the claims made in this paper. 

It is incorrect to copy/steal the ideas of this paper without using proper citation. Thus, please give credit to me and/or
the authors this paper cites.
